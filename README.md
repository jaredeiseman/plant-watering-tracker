# React Week 01 Independent Project

#### An app to help a nursery track watering intervals for varying plant types.

#### By Jared Eiseman

## Description
An application that will allow nursery employees view a list of all plant types in the nursery along with the intervals in which those plants should be watered, along with a timer since last time the plant was watered. Employees can also add new plants to the list with a custom timer.

## Planning

### Features needed
* The app should list the different varieties of plants in the store. (General categories are fine. ie: "Succulents", "Tropical", "Fruit trees", "Tomatoes", "Houseplants", etc.)

* It should offer a form where a user can add new varieties of plants, including a name, and how often they need to be watered. (ie: Every 7 days, every 4 days, every 30 days, etc.)

* It should allow the user to remove a plant type from the list entirely, in case the store stops selling that plant for a season.

* There should a button next to each type of plant. The user can click this button after watering it, so the watering countdown starts over again.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repository (https://github.com/jaredeiseman/plant-watering-tracker.git).
* Run 'npm install' in your chosen terminal application.
* Run 'npm run start' in your chosen terminal application for a development server.
* Navigate to 'http://localhost:8080' in your browser of choice.
